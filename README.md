# Contributing Guidelines

## These are few needed things for contributing to Leafy

You should use pre-commit.

```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit  # required only once
pre-commit install
```

That's it! The plugin will run every time you commit any changes. If there are any errors found during the run, fix them and commit those changes. You can even run the plugin manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
```
* Note - Use `.env` or `.venv` instead of `env` or `venv` ( virtual environments ). It is to prevent pre-commit from scanning them.


Also, great thanks to [python discord bot](https://github.com/python-discord/bot)! DevBot uses some of their's code
